#one single and one double quotation

print = 'Hello World!'
#missing brackets

sum = 1 + 2
print('sum')
#'sum' is a string. this will print the word sum

print("Hello World"\n)
#\n is not inside the quotations. alternatively, \n could stand alone
#the correct way would be:
print("Hello World\n")
#or
print("Hello World" + "\n")

message = 'Spam'
print('I love' message)
print(Message*5)
#no brackets around 'spam'
#message is not defined
#Message should be message. lower case m

greeting = Welcome to the course
Print(Greeting)
#Greetings should be greetings. lower case g
#Welcome to the course should have quotations

print('Welcome' + 'to' + 'the' + 'course')
#this would output: Welcometothecourse
