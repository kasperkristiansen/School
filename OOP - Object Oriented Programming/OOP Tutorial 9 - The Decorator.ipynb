    "The decorator is often difficult to understand without the aid of a working example. The following code for the example used in class is provided to ensure you have such an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a new set of classes implementing the decorator for a different context as discussed below:\n",

    "#### Travel Claims\n",
    "In many organisations employees might be required to travel as part of their work. In such cases it is common practice to allow them to submit a receipt of expenses to claim back money spend on meals, taxi rides, etc. Usually an employee will submit several reciepts as part of a single trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "You task is to write a class Claim that will allow our bookeeping system's programmers to store and manipulate the data that is submitted for such a receipt. However, not all receipts are in our local currency. A receipt that was submitted for an expense in EUR, SEK, USD, GBP, etc must be converted to NOK before we can refund the claim. The exact rate at which such a conversion is done will change on a daily basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to company policy each claim should be refunded at the exchange rate for the day on which it is submitted. The decorator is perfect for this since an object cannot be \"unwrapped\" once the currency has been changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt the given example to implement such a claims object. Usually such an object would also contain code to lookup the daily currency exchange rates. However, for simplicity you may hardcode these rates for each supported currency."
